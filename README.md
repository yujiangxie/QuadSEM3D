QuadSEM3D is the 3D version of QuadSEM (https://github.com/yujiangxie/QuadSEM), which is based on the SPECFEM3D package. I constructed QuadSEM3D by modifying the src folder of SPECFEM3D. In other words, QuadSEM3D can solve four wave equations simultaneously, whereas SPECFEM3D can only solve one or two wave equations at a time.
