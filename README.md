QuadSEM3D is the 3D version of QuadSEM (https://github.com/yujiangxie/QuadSEM), which is based on the SPECFEM3D package. I constructed QuadSEM3D by modifying the src folder of SPECFEM3D. In other words, QuadSEM3D can solve four wave equations simultaneously, whereas SPECFEM3D can only solve one or two wave equations at a time.

One can use it in essentially the same way as SPECFEM3D; I have kept it as similar to SPECFEM3D as possible. The key difference is that QuadSEM3D can work with two models simultaneously.
